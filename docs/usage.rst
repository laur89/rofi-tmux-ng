Usage
=====

Few things to keep in mind when using rft:

#. rft doesn't launch a terminal/client automatically for you, so you need to start
   your main client manually.
#. rft caches the last tmux session/window you have switched from either using rft
   or in tmux client itself, so it automatically pre-selects it in the rofi prompt,
   assuming the client window is visible; if it is not, rft assumes you probably want
   to switch over to the same session/window that is currently opened/active.


I recommend that you have shortcuts with control modifiers for rft, so if you always
have a tmux session running, it's going to be really fast to find this session and
switch to it. For example, I use these key bindings on i3 for launching rft:

.. code:: shell

    set $mod Mod4
    set $ex  exec --no-startup-id

    bindsym $mod+w       $ex  killall -s SIGUSR1 rft-daemon
    bindsym $mod+e       $ex  killall -s SIGUSR2 rft-daemon
    bindsym $mod+g       $ex  rft sw --global_scope false
    bindsym $mod+Shift+w $ex  rft kw

.. note::

    If you haven't added ``$HOME/.local/bin`` to your ``$PATH``, then you'll have to
    define rft command as ``$HOME/.local/bin/rft``, as that's where pipx-installed
    executables are placed by default.

The first two are the ones that I use the most. They're for switching to a session
(`ss`) and switching to a window globally (`sw`).
To check all rft actions available:

.. code:: shell

  ‚ùØ rft
